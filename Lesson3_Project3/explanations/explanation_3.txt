The heap sort takes O(log n) computation. The main work is done in the while-loop of MaxSumNumbers() function which takes O(n) computations in worst case. Therefore all together, finding the answer takes O(n) computations.

The space complexity is O(n) for heap sort whereas MaxSumNumbers() function takes O(1) space. Hence, total space requirement is O(n).
